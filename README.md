```CHROME WEB STORE STATUS: Pending review...```

CHCal is a free and open-source calculator for Chrome. It's a small extension and appears in your browser. I really only used this to test out the Developer Dashboard since I just got into Chrome Web Store!

## Install Instructions

#### On Chrome Web Store:

> It's still under review, i'll add a link here when it gets put up!

#### With Extension ZIP

- Go to the latest release not marked ```unpackaged```.
- Download the .zip extension file, the format is: ```CHCal-1.0.0-extraw.zip```.

- Now go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).

- On the right top side of the screen, tick on Developer Mode (or if it's already enabled, go to the next step)

- **IMPORTANT!** Unzip your file now. Place it in it's own seperate folder.
- Now go back to the extensions page, and click **Load Unpacked**.
- Find your file, and import it.

- After that, it should show up as a new extension. Pin it to the extensions bar and use it for whatever!
